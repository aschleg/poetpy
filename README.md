## Requirements

* Python 3.4+
  - `poetpy` should also work fine on Python 2.7, however; given that 2.7 support 
    will be discontinued in the near future, 2.7 will not be tested or supported.
* `requests >= 2.18`

## See Also

* [PoetryDB](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) Github page with more information 
  regarding the implementation and design of PoetryDB and its API. The README of the 
  repository also contains other examples for working with the API (though not in Python).
